# Mega Girl
### Mintbean Hackathon - Requirements
Love has infinite dimensions. Your video game will only have two.

- You can build any game you'd like. Whether it's Tetris, Super Mario, Civilization, Diablo, Slime Volleyball (remember that?), or just a ball bouncing around on a screen, as long as it sticks to the following requirements:
- Your game has to be 2D. Isometric view is OK as long as there are only 2 dimensions that your character can move in.
- Your game must have a clear win condition. For example, in some games, beating the boss monster.
- Your game must have a clear lose condition. For example, in some games, losing all your lives.
- Your game's frontend must be built in JavaScript or Typescript.
- You can only use packages that you can download off NPM, and you cannot use professional game engines like Unreal, Unity or Godot. (If in doubt, ask)
- Your application must have a clear landing page. See the Hiring Hackathon Guide for more info.
